Routing Example


1. Web Apps
Web Apps are of two types, based on how we get content:
Multi-page application (MPA)
Single-page application (SPA)


1.1 Multi-page application (MPA)
Every URL is associated with corresponding resources (HTML, CSS, JS).
The browser downloads these resources when you access them or navigate between URLs.

1.2 Single-page application (SPA)
All URLs are associated with a single HTML page.
On navigating we only get the additional content (Component - HTML, CSS, JS).

1.2.1 Advantages of using Single-page application (SPA)
Faster Page loading - since they load only necessary Component (HTML, CSS, JS) resources on subsequent requests.
React is mainly used to build Single-page applications.
